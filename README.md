# **Hotel Revenue Insights Dashboard**

## **Project Overview**

Welcome to the **Hotel Revenue Insights Dashboard** repository! This project is designed to analyze and visualize key performance metrics for a fictional hotel company, At Lake Grants. The primary objective of this project is to provide actionable insights into the hotel's revenue, occupancy, and overall performance, enabling management to make informed decisions and optimize their operations.

## **Features**

- **Dynamic Revenue Analysis:** Visualize total revenue across different room types, booking platforms, and time periods.
- **Occupancy Trends:** Analyze occupancy rates over time to identify trends and optimize hotel operations.
- **Key Metrics Visualization:** Track crucial metrics such as ADR (Average Daily Rate), RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room), Occupancy Rate, and Realisation Percentage.
- **Booking Platform Performance:** Compare the effectiveness of different booking platforms in terms of revenue generation and realization rates.
- **Filter Options:** Utilize interactive filters for city, room type, and date to customize the analysis.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project includes:
- **Booking Information:** Details of customer bookings, including check-in/check-out dates, room types, and booking platforms.
- **Revenue Data:** Financial records detailing revenue generated from various room types and booking platforms.
- **Occupancy Data:** Information on room occupancy, including the number of rooms available and occupied.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Data on customer demographics and booking preferences.

**Note:** The dataset is fictional and was created specifically for the purposes of this project.

## **Data Transformation**

Before analysis, the raw data underwent several transformation steps using Power Query:
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and normalized data formats.
- **Data Merging:** Combined multiple datasets to create a unified view of the hotel’s operations.
- **Schema Design:** A star schema was implemented to facilitate efficient querying and reporting, with a fact table for bookings and dimension tables for room types, booking platforms, and customer demographics.

## **DAX Calculations**

The project makes extensive use of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns and measures. Key DAX calculations include:
- **Total Revenue:** Calculation of total revenue generated across all transactions.
- **RevPAR:** Revenue per available room, calculated as `Total Room Revenue / Total Rooms Available`.
- **ADR:** Average daily rate, calculated as `Total Revenue / Total Rooms Sold`.
- **Occupancy Rate:** Percentage of rooms occupied, calculated as `Occupied Rooms / Total Available Rooms`.
- **Realisation Percentage:** A measure to evaluate the effectiveness of different booking platforms in converting potential bookings into actual revenue.

## **Dashboard Overview**

The Power BI dashboard is divided into several sections:
- **High-Level KPIs:** Displays key metrics such as Revenue, ADR, RevPAR, and Occupancy Rate at the top for quick reference.
- **Revenue by Category:** A donut chart breaking down revenue by luxury vs. business bookings.
- **Trend Analysis:** Line charts showing weekly trends in RevPAR, ADR, and Occupancy Rate.
- **Booking Platform Performance:** A bar chart comparing the realization percentage and ADR across different booking platforms.
- **Detailed Data Table:** A table providing granular details on each property’s performance, including revenue, occupancy, and cancellation rates.

## **Insights and Recommendations**

Key insights derived from the analysis include:
- **Dynamic Pricing Strategy:** Adoption of a dynamic pricing strategy to optimize revenue during peak seasons.
- **Occupancy Optimization:** Targeted marketing campaigns during off-peak periods to increase occupancy.
- **Platform Efficiency:** Strengthening direct booking channels while maintaining a presence on third-party platforms.

## **Challenges and Solutions**

### **Challenges:**
- **Performance Optimization:** Initially, the dashboard experienced slow load times due to the large volume of data and complex DAX calculations.
  
### **Solutions:**
- **DAX Optimization:** Simplified DAX measures to improve calculation efficiency.
- **Data Model Refinement:** Reduced the complexity of relationships between tables and optimized the data schema.
- **Visual Optimization:** Streamlined the number of visuals per page and used bookmarks for a smoother user experience.

## **How to Use**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hotel-revenue-insights-dashboard.git
   ```

2. **Open the Power BI File:**
   - Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.

3. **Explore the Dashboard:**
   - Use the interactive filters and visuals to explore different aspects of the hotel's performance.

4. **Modify the Dataset:**
   - If needed, you can modify the dataset by using Power Query to import new data or update existing data.

## **Conclusion**

The Hotel Revenue Insights Dashboard provides a powerful tool for hotel management to analyze key performance metrics, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. By leveraging Power BI’s capabilities, this project demonstrates the value of data visualization in enhancing business operations and optimizing revenue.
